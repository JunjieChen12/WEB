        <h2>October 11th 2025: Assignment 1</h2>
        <p>This is a <a href="index.html">link to my home page</a>.</p>

        <h3>The thing that challenged me the most was uploading my picture to my webpage.</h3> 
        <p>I worked through it by searching up how to upload an image on google as well as checking the Ed that you have to upload your photo to the A1 file.</p>
        
        <h3>What did you learn from this assignemnt? What did you already know?</h3>
        <p>I learned how to adjust the size of an image. Things I knew were the basic syntax of html.</p>
       
        <h3>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Ed forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment?  How did you use these resources?</h3>
        <p>I used this website :https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp, And the class Ed forum: https://edstem.org/us/courses/87513/discussion/7060123</p>
        <p>I wasn't sure how to insert and resize my image this is when the first link came to help me.</p>
        <p>The second link(ed forum) is where I got my picture to load.</p>
