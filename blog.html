        <h3>The thing that challenged me the most was uploading my picture to my webpage.</h3>

        <h3>What did you learn from this assignemnt? What did you already know?</h3>
        <p>I learned how to adjust the size of an image. Things I knew were the basic syntax of html.</p>
       
        <h3>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Ed forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment?  How did you use these resources?</h3>
        <p>I used this website :https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp, And the class Ed forum: https://edstem.org/us/courses/87513/discussion/7060123</p>
        <p>I wasn't sure how to insert and resize my image this is when the first link came to help me.</p>

                <p><strong>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</strong></p>
                <li>The challenging thing about this assignemnt was getting the "perfect fit" for everything. A specific problem I had was making the post right. I solved it by tweaking things in small intervals and finding the right fit. </li>
                <p><strong>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</strong></p>
                <li>I learned how to use CSS with html to design a website. An insight I had was creating a button with interactions. Something that I found that I already knew was fonts, sizing, colors, and positioning things.</li>
                <p><strong>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</strong></p>
                <li>W3schools was very helpful for completing the assignment. They provided examples of what css funcitons did and how they work.</li>
                <p><strong>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</strong></p>
                <li>One thing I had to google was the eye dropper to get the color of the buttons.</li>
